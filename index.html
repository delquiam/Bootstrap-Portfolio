        <p>My name is Rhea and my greatest accomplishment is being a mother of 4 beautiful kids. Madison is 15, Noah is
          12,
          Logan is 10, and Kendall is 8. I am married to my best friend Ed, who I met in college. I grew up as a navy
          brat, so I lived in many different places. I was born in Portsmouth, Virginia, and moved to Honolulu, Hawaii.
          After Hawaii, I lived in Seattle, Washington and then Port Hueneme, California. Then in the 7th grade, I
          moved
          to Orlando, Florida where I went to high school and college. I moved to California to attend Loma Linda
          University and have been here since. By trade, I am a cytotechnologist. What is that you ask? Well, cyto is
          the
          study of cells. So, I microscopically look at cells, looking for abnormalities, specifically cancer cells.
          Due
          to my field fading, I have decided to take on a new career path, and that is why I am in this class.
